This textfile documents the usage and purpose of this Shiny application.

For people who are new to modeling, the concept of spliting your data into training and testing might be new.

To let them have a better understanding on how the split of the data in modeling affects the accuracy of the model,
this simple and interactive application allows them to play around with the proportion and look at how the accuracy of the model changes along with a change in the proportion of split between test and train data.

On the left hand side, user jus have to key in values between 0 to 1, in steps of .05, and see the change in the accuracy of the model.

A tick box is there if user do not want to see the result.

The projection model used behind this Shiny application is the Decision Tree model and the data used is the 'IRIS' data and we are trying to predict the Spiece of a plant using other varibles like Sepal Length ,Sepal Width,Petal Length and Petal Width.
